# Angular Nested Router Outlets

This project is a simple proof of concept on how to use Angular router-outlets to easily render components in different page sections.

There are two demos:

master branch: Nested router-outlets using static loading
lazy-loading branch: Nested router-outlets using lazy-loading

As of Angular 9.1, lazy-loading still has an issue that prevents direct mapping from static to lazy-loadig mode.

The issue is described here: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/10981
